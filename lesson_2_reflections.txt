"What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?"

The .git hidden directory is created within current directory. Initially there
are no commits.

"How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?"

Files in the working directory are not automatically tracked by git, until added to the staging area with "git add <filename>". The repository (I think) is the commit history of all files that have been added. I'm hazy on the repository concept.
